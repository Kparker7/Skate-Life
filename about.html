      <h2>Why Skateboarding?</h2>
      <p>Skateboarding is more than just a sport. It's a community, an art, and a way of life. It teaches balance, persistence, creativity, and self expression. From street skating to park contests, skating is always evolving and brings people together across generations.</p>

      <h2>History of Skateboarding</h2>
      <p>Skateboarding began back in the 1950s in California, when surfers wanted to recreate the feel of surfing on land. Since then, it's grown into a global movement with its own style, competitions like the X Games and the Olympics, and legendary skaters like Tony Hawk and Rodney Mullen inspiring new generations.</p>
